            Athena was a former assassin working in the Crimson Lance, a private mercenary army
            hired by the megacorporation, Atlas. She was sent by Atlas to the planet Pandora
            to aid the corporation's search for alien technology. In addition to following
            orders, her main objective on Pandora was to find her long-lost sister, Jess. Her plan was
            to leave the Crimson Lance after she found her sister. When the Crimson Lance found out, they ordered a
            total annihilation of the village that Jess lived in to keep Athena from leaving
            the corps. Later, Athena found out she accidentally killed her sister. She left the Crimson Lance, plotting
            to kill the general who ordered the attack on her sister's village. Once he was killed, she wandered
            around Pandora aimlessly, looking for a job. Eventually, she was hired by Jack to go to the moon Elpis
            and investigate a Vault.

            <p>Out of four Vault Hunters that Jack hired, Athena may have been the only one with
            somewhat of a moral compass. Even then, her motivations were mainly due to money. She recognized Jack's gradual moral decay later in the game, which
            prompted her to give up the money that he paid her. Despite this, she still went back to Jack for one final
            job when she was unable to find a more stable source of income.</p>

        <div class="wilhelm_info">
          Wilhelm's past is largely a mystery, and the only real details about his childhood that were revealed
          was that he was born with a bone disease that required him to get cybernetic implants at a young age.
          Consequently, he became addicted to obtaining cybernetic enhancements.

          Throughout the game, many characters warn him about the ethical implications of receiving so many
          cybernetic implants. He's told that at some point, he'll become a remorseless killer who's more machine
          than man. Wilhelm disregards these warnings, not because he's not worried about becoming more machine than man,
          but because he doesn't see a problem with it. This directly leads to Wilhelm's future employment as one of Jack's most
          trusted employees, since Jack knows he can trust him to carry out his will with no hesitation or weight on his conscience.

          <p>Wilhelm makes an appearance in Borderlands 2 as a boss, in which he's become around 65% robot. Jack claims to have made Wilhelm's dream come
          true, and given him all the implants he could ever ask for. </p>
